        <p>Effective altruism is about answering one simple question: how can we use our resources to <b>help others the most</b>? We use <b>evidence and careful analysis</b> to find the very best causes to work on.</p>

        <p>But it's no use answering the question unless you act on it. Effective altruism is about following through. It's about <b>being generous with your time and your money</b> to do the most good you can.</p>

        <p>We are the <b>McGill University chapter</b> of effective altruism, aiming to promote the movement on campus and in the Montr√©al area.</p>
