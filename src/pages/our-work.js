                    <h3>Effective Altruism Fellowship</h3>
                    <p>Every fall semester, we run an effective altruism fellowship. Each week during the program, the cohort of fellows will read about a certain topic within effective altruism and then meets to discuss it.</p>

                    <p>In the process, fellows gain access to guest speakers/professors and confront moral questions alongside a group of intelligent and open-minded individuals. At the end of the fellowship, the fellows collectively decide on a charity to which they want to donate.</p>

                    <p>Stay posted for information about 2021's fellowship!</p>

        <h3>Weekly Meetings</h3>
        <p>In the winter semester, we run weekly meetings <b>Wednesdays at 6:30PM Montr√©al time</b>, open to all. Similarly to the fellowship, we discuss a different topic each week, often relating to current events or current debates within effective altruism. Occaisonally, we will invite guest speakers as well!

        <h3>EA Library</h3>
        <p>We have many books relating to effective altruism, and lend them out to anybody who wants to learn more! When on-campus life picks up, we will have an in-person location for them. In the meantime, we will mail you the books.
