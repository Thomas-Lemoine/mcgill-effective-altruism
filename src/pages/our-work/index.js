                    <h3>Effective Altruism Fellowship</h3>
                    <p>Every fall semester, we run an effective altruism fellowship. Each week during the program, the cohort of fellows will read about a certain topic within effective altruism and then meets to discuss it.</p>

                    <p>In the process, fellows gain access to guest speakers/professors and confront moral questions alongside a group of intelligent and open-minded individuals. At the end of the fellowship, the fellows collectively decide on a charity to which they want to donate.</p>

                    <p>Stay posted for information about 2021's fellowship!</p>

        <h3>Weekly Meetings</h3>
        <p>In the winter semester, we run weekly meetings <b>Wednesdays at 6:30PM Montr√©al time</b>, open to all. Similarly to the fellowship, we discuss a different topic each week, often relating to current events or current debates within effective altruism.

        <h3>Advising</h3>
        <p>We partner with other organizations at McGill to increase the impact of their donations. Recently, we have worked with sororities to do so. If you are interested in partnering, please <Link to="/connect">connect with us</Link>! </p>
