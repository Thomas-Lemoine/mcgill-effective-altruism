        <h3>Fellowship</h3>
        <p>Every fall semester, we run an effective altruism fellowship. Each week during the program, the cohort of fellows will read about a certain topic within effective altruism and then meets to discuss it. In the process, fellows gain access to guest speakers/professors and confront moral questions alongside a group of intelligent and open-minded individuals. At the end of the fellowship, the fellows collectively decide on a charity to which they want to donate.</p>

        {/* TODO: figure out a way to give access to the Zoom link/schedule */}

        <h3>Advising</h3>
