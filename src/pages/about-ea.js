        <h2>About Effective Altruism</h2>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>Most of us want to make a difference. We see suffering, injustice and death, and are moved to do something about them. But working out what that ‘something’ is, let alone actually doing it, can be a difficult and disheartening challenge.</p>

        <p>Effective altruism is a response to this challenge. It is a research field which uses high-quality evidence and careful reasoning to work out how to help others as much as possible. It is also a community of people taking these answers seriously, by focusing their efforts on the most promising solutions to the world's most pressing problems.</p>

        <h4>The Framework</h4>
        <p>In general, we evaluate the most worthwhile causes on the following criteria:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><i>Great in scale</i> (it affects many lives, by a great amount)</li>
            <li><i>Highly neglected</i> (few other people are working on addressing it)</li>
            <li><i>Highly tractable</i> (additional resources will do a great deal to address it)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Cause Areas</h4>
        <p>Based on those criteria, Effective Altruism focuses on three main cause areas:</p>
        {/* TODO: a little writeup about each cause area */}
        <h5>Extreme Poverty</h5>
        <h5>Animal Welfare</h5>
        <h5>Long-Term Future</h5>

        {/* TODO: summarize the different ways in which one can take action */}
