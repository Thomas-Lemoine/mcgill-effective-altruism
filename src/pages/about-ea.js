        <h2>About Effective Altruism</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Most of us want to make a difference. We see suffering, injustice and death, and are moved to do something about them. But working out what that ‘something’ is, let alone actually doing it, can be a difficult and disheartening challenge.</p>

        <p>Effective altruism is a response to this challenge. It is a research field which uses high-quality evidence and careful reasoning to work out how to help others as much as possible. It is also a community of people taking these answers seriously, by focusing their efforts on the most promising solutions to the world's most pressing problems.</p>

        <h3>The Framework</h3>
        <p>In general, we evaluate the most worthwhile causes on the following criteria:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><i>Great in scale</i> (it affects many lives, by a great amount)</li>
            <li><i>Highly neglected</i> (few other people are working on addressing it)</li>
            <li><i>Highly tractable</i> (additional resources will do a great deal to address it)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Based on those criteria, effective altruism focuses on three main cause areas: extreme poverty, animal welfare, and long-term future.</p>

        <h3>Taking Action</h3>
        <p>In response to this research, effective altruists take a variety of actions. First and foremost, we evaluate charities based on how effective they are. Then, we act as part of the solutions to these problems by pledging to give non-trivial amounts of our own wealth towards them.</p>

        <p>We also investigate how one's career path can do the most good. For most of us, a significant amount of our productive waking life — over 80,000 hours on average — is spent working. This is an enormous resource that can be used to make the world better. If you can increase your impact by just 1%, that's equivalent to 800 hours of extra work.</p>

        <p>Lastly, we try to spread the word and make these ideas more widespread and accessible. That's the goal Effective Altruists at McGill - to spread these ideas within the McGill community!</p>
